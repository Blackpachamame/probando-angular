Build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` folder and optimized for performance.

## 🌐 API

This project includes a backend API built with Node.js, located in the `api/` directory.
The API uses in-memory data storage, which means all data is reset every time the server restarts.

cd api
npm i
npm run start:dev
```
